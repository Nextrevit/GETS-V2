Thank you for downloading Google Earth Trucking Simulator V1.

How to install:

(1). Copy the folder named "res". Make sure to copy the WHOLE folder or else you will be missing files.

(2). Navigate to where Google Earth is saved to your PC.
In my case, C:\Program Files\Google\Google Earth Pro\client is where you will need to go.

If you installed Google Earth in a different directory, just search for a folder named "Google" > "Google Earth Pro" > "client".

(3). Once you have navigated to the "client" folder in Google Earth ("C:\Program Files\Google\Google Earth Pro\client", it may be different on which directory you installed GE in)

(4). Delete the "res" folder (OR drag it to a different directory AWAY from Google Earth files).

(5). Paste the "res" folder that you copied into the "client" directory.

Now, go back to where you downloaded GETS V1. Open the "Google Earth Trucking Simulator .exe file.

You may start the simulation by clicking (in GE) Tools > Flight Simulator > SR22.

If there is a error repeat all the above steps.
